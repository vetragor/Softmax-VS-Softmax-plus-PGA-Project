# Softmax-VS-Softmax-plus-PGA-Project
This project covers Softmax algorithm and  Principal Components Analysis (PGA). In the first part I use my Softmax algorithm to train and test number images to evaluate error of my Softmax. In the second part I use PGA to reduce 784 pixel images to 21 pixels and then  I train and test Softmax accuracy with 21 pixel images.   The MNIST database contains binary images of handwritten digits commonly used to train image processing systems. The digits were collected from among Census Bureau employees and high school students. The database contains 60,000 training digits and 10,000 testing digits, all of which have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image of 28 Ã— 28 pixels.
